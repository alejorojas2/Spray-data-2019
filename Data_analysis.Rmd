title: "Spray data - _B. glumae_"

Data of 10 cultivars of rice inoculated with _B. glumae_ or mock inoculated.  Discoloration of spikelets were recorded and presented as percentage.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

rice_data <- read_excel("Spray-Data-06.18.20.xlsx")
rice_data
```

We still have to "reshape" the table to make it in longer format coding a column for treatment (Mock vs Inoculated) and temperature profile (30-22 vs 30-28).

```{r}
(rice_data_long <- rice_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("Mock_30C-22C", "Mock_30C-28C", 
                        "Pathogen_30C-22C", "Pathogen_30C-28C"),
               names_to = "Inoculation", 
               values_to = "DiscPerc") %>%
   separate(col = Inoculation, 
            sep = "_",
            into = c("Inoculation", "TempProfile")))
```
